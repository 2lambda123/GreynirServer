    TnT - Statistical POS tagger
    IMPORTANT NOTES:
    * DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY DEAL WITH UNSEEN WORDS
      - It is possible to provide an untrained POS tagger to
        create tags for unknown words, see __init__ function
    * SHOULD BE USED WITH SENTENCE-DELIMITED INPUT
      - Due to the nature of this tagger, it works best when
        trained over sentence delimited input.
      - However it still produces good results if the training
        data and testing data are separated on all punctuation eg: [,.?!]
      - Input for training is expected to be a list of sentences
        where each sentence is a list of (word, tag) tuples
      - Input for tag function is a single sentence
        Input for tagdata function is a list of sentences
        Output is of a similar form
    * Function provided to process text that is unsegmented
      - Please see basic_sent_chop()
    TnT uses a second order Markov model to produce tags for
    a sequence of input, specifically:
      argmax [Proj(P(t_i|t_i-1,t_i-2)P(w_i|t_i))] P(t_T+1 | t_T)
    IE: the maximum projection of a set of probabilities
    The set of possible tags for a given word is derived
    from the training data. It is the set of all tags
    that exact word has been assigned.
    To speed up and get more precision, we can use log addition
    to instead multiplication, specifically:
      argmax [Sigma(log(P(t_i|t_i-1,t_i-2))+log(P(w_i|t_i)))] +
             log(P(t_T+1|t_T))
    The probability of a tag for a given word is the linear
    interpolation of 3 markov models; a zero-order, first-order,
    and a second order model.
      P(t_i| t_i-1, t_i-2) = l1*P(t_i) + l2*P(t_i| t_i-1) +
                             l3*P(t_i| t_i-1, t_i-2)
    A beam search is used to limit the memory usage of the algorithm.
    The degree of the beam can be changed using N in the initialization.
    N represents the maximum number of possible solutions to maintain
    while tagging.
    It is possible to differentiate the tags which are assigned to
    capitalized words. However this does not result in a significant
    gain in the accuracy of the results.
